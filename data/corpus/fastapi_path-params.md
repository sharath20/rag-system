Path Parameters
¶
You can declare path "parameters" or "variables" with the same syntax used by Python format strings:
Python 3.10+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
async
def
read_item
(
item_id
):
return
{
"item_id"
:
item_id
}
The value of the path parameter
item_id
will be passed to your function as the argument
item_id
.
So, if you run this example and go to
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo
, you will see a response of:
{
"item_id"
:
"foo"
}
Path parameters with types
¶
You can declare the type of a path parameter in the function, using standard Python type annotations:
Python 3.10+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/
{item_id}
"
)
async
def
read_item
(
item_id
:
int
):
return
{
"item_id"
:
item_id
}
In this case,
item_id
is declared to be an
int
.
Tip
This will give you editor support inside of your function, with error checks, completion, etc.
Data
conversion
¶
If you run this example and open your browser at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/3
, you will see a response of:
{
"item_id"
:
3
}
Tip
Notice that the value your function received (and returned) is
3
, as a Python
int
, not a string
"3"
.
So, with that type declaration,
FastAPI
gives you automatic request
"parsing"
.
Data validation
¶
But if you go to the browser at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo
, you will see a nice HTTP error of:
{
"detail"
:
[
{
"type"
:
"int_parsing"
,
"loc"
:
[
"path"
,
"item_id"
],
"msg"
:
"Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer"
,
"input"
:
"foo"
}
]
}
because the path parameter
item_id
had a value of
"foo"
, which is not an
int
.
The same error would appear if you provided a
float
instead of an
int
, as in:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/4.2
Tip
So, with the same Python type declaration,
FastAPI
gives you data validation.
Notice that the error also clearly states exactly the point where the validation didn't pass.
This is incredibly helpful while developing and debugging code that interacts with your API.
Documentation
¶
And when you open your browser at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
, you will see an automatic, interactive, API documentation like:
Tip
Again, just with that same Python type declaration,
FastAPI
gives you automatic, interactive documentation (integrating Swagger UI).
Notice that the path parameter is declared to be an integer.
Standards-based benefits, alternative documentation
¶
And because the generated schema is from the
OpenAPI
standard, there are many compatible tools.
Because of this,
FastAPI
itself provides an alternative API documentation (using ReDoc), which you can access at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
:
The same way, there are many compatible tools. Including code generation tools for many languages.
Pydantic
¶
All the data validation is performed under the hood by
Pydantic
, so you get all the benefits from it. And you know you are in good hands.
You can use the same type declarations with
str
,
float
,
bool
and many other complex data types.
Several of these are explored in the next chapters of the tutorial.
Order matters
¶
When creating
path operations
, you can find situations where you have a fixed path.
Like
/users/me
, let's say that it's to get data about the current user.
And then you can also have a path
/users/{user_id}
to get data about a specific user by some user ID.
Because
path operations
are evaluated in order, you need to make sure that the path for
/users/me
is declared before the one for
/users/{user_id}
:
Python 3.10+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/users/me"
)
async
def
read_user_me
():
return
{
"user_id"
:
"the current user"
}
@app
.
get
(
"/users/
{user_id}
"
)
async
def
read_user
(
user_id
:
str
):
return
{
"user_id"
:
user_id
}
Otherwise, the path for
/users/{user_id}
would match also for
/users/me
, "thinking" that it's receiving a parameter
user_id
with a value of
"me"
.
Similarly, you cannot redefine a path operation:
Python 3.10+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/users"
)
async
def
read_users
():
return
[
"Rick"
,
"Morty"
]
@app
.
get
(
"/users"
)
async
def
read_users2
():
return
[
"Bean"
,
"Elfo"
]
The first one will always be used since the path matches first.
Predefined values
¶
If you have a
path operation
that receives a
path parameter
, but you want the possible valid
path parameter
values to be predefined, you can use a standard Python
Enum
.
Create an
Enum
class
¶
Import
Enum
and create a sub-class that inherits from
str
and from
Enum
.
By inheriting from
str
the API docs will be able to know that the values must be of type
string
and will be able to render correctly.
Then create class attributes with fixed values, which will be the available valid values:
Python 3.10+
from
enum
import
Enum
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
class
ModelName
(
str
,
Enum
):
alexnet
=
"alexnet"
resnet
=
"resnet"
lenet
=
"lenet"
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/models/
{model_name}
"
)
async
def
get_model
(
model_name
:
ModelName
):
if
model_name
is
ModelName
.
alexnet
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Deep Learning FTW!"
}
if
model_name
.
value
==
"lenet"
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"LeCNN all the images"
}
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Have some residuals"
}
Tip
If you are wondering, "AlexNet", "ResNet", and "LeNet" are just names of Machine Learning
models
.
Declare a
path parameter
¶
Then create a
path parameter
with a type annotation using the enum class you created (
ModelName
):
Python 3.10+
from
enum
import
Enum
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
class
ModelName
(
str
,
Enum
):
alexnet
=
"alexnet"
resnet
=
"resnet"
lenet
=
"lenet"
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/models/
{model_name}
"
)
async
def
get_model
(
model_name
:
ModelName
):
if
model_name
is
ModelName
.
alexnet
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Deep Learning FTW!"
}
if
model_name
.
value
==
"lenet"
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"LeCNN all the images"
}
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Have some residuals"
}
Check the docs
¶
Because the available values for the
path parameter
are predefined, the interactive docs can show them nicely:
Working with Python
enumerations
¶
The value of the
path parameter
will be an
enumeration member
.
Compare
enumeration members
¶
You can compare it with the
enumeration member
in your created enum
ModelName
:
Python 3.10+
from
enum
import
Enum
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
class
ModelName
(
str
,
Enum
):
alexnet
=
"alexnet"
resnet
=
"resnet"
lenet
=
"lenet"
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/models/
{model_name}
"
)
async
def
get_model
(
model_name
:
ModelName
):
if
model_name
is
ModelName
.
alexnet
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Deep Learning FTW!"
}
if
model_name
.
value
==
"lenet"
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"LeCNN all the images"
}
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Have some residuals"
}
Get the
enumeration value
¶
You can get the actual value (a
str
in this case) using
model_name.value
, or in general,
your_enum_member.value
:
Python 3.10+
from
enum
import
Enum
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
class
ModelName
(
str
,
Enum
):
alexnet
=
"alexnet"
resnet
=
"resnet"
lenet
=
"lenet"
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/models/
{model_name}
"
)
async
def
get_model
(
model_name
:
ModelName
):
if
model_name
is
ModelName
.
alexnet
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Deep Learning FTW!"
}
if
model_name
.
value
==
"lenet"
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"LeCNN all the images"
}
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Have some residuals"
}
Tip
You could also access the value
"lenet"
with
ModelName.lenet.value
.
Return
enumeration members
¶
You can return
enum members
from your
path operation
, even nested in a JSON body (e.g. a
dict
).
They will be converted to their corresponding values (strings in this case) before returning them to the client:
Python 3.10+
from
enum
import
Enum
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
class
ModelName
(
str
,
Enum
):
alexnet
=
"alexnet"
resnet
=
"resnet"
lenet
=
"lenet"
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/models/
{model_name}
"
)
async
def
get_model
(
model_name
:
ModelName
):
if
model_name
is
ModelName
.
alexnet
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Deep Learning FTW!"
}
if
model_name
.
value
==
"lenet"
:
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"LeCNN all the images"
}
return
{
"model_name"
:
model_name
,
"message"
:
"Have some residuals"
}
In your client you will get a JSON response like:
{
"model_name"
:
"alexnet"
,
"message"
:
"Deep Learning FTW!"
}
Path parameters containing paths
¶
Let's say you have a
path operation
with a path
/files/{file_path}
.
But you need
file_path
itself to contain a
path
, like
home/johndoe/myfile.txt
.
So, the URL for that file would be something like:
/files/home/johndoe/myfile.txt
.
OpenAPI support
¶
OpenAPI doesn't support a way to declare a
path parameter
to contain a
path
inside, as that could lead to scenarios that are difficult to test and define.
Nevertheless, you can still do it in
FastAPI
, using one of the internal tools from Starlette.
And the docs would still work, although not adding any documentation telling that the parameter should contain a path.
Path convertor
¶
Using an option directly from Starlette you can declare a
path parameter
containing a
path
using a URL like:
/files/{file_path:path}
In this case, the name of the parameter is
file_path
, and the last part,
:path
, tells it that the parameter should match any
path
.
So, you can use it with:
Python 3.10+
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/files/{file_path:path}"
)
async
def
read_file
(
file_path
:
str
):
return
{
"file_path"
:
file_path
}
Tip
You might need the parameter to contain
/home/johndoe/myfile.txt
, with a leading slash (
/
).
In that case, the URL would be:
/files//home/johndoe/myfile.txt
, with a double slash (
//
) between
files
and
home
.
Recap
¶
With
FastAPI
, by using short, intuitive and standard Python type declarations, you get:
Editor support: error checks, autocompletion, etc.
Data "
parsing
"
Data validation
API annotation and automatic documentation
And you only have to declare them once.
That's probably the main visible advantage of
FastAPI
compared to alternative frameworks (apart from the raw performance).
